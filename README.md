# Compound-Interest-Modelling-Python
Plotting compound interest over time for a range of scenarios.

Scenario 1: Initial = 10000, Interest Rate = 7, Compounds Per Year = 12.  
Scenario 2: Initial = 10000, Interest Rate = 4, Compounds Per Year = 12.  
Scenario 3: Initial = 25000, Interest Rate = 7, Compounds Per Year = 12.  
Scenario 4: Initial = 25000, Interest Rate = 4, Compounds Per Year = 12.  
Scenario 5: Initial = 10000, Interest Rate = 7, Compounds Per Year = 1.  
Scenario 6: Initial = 10000, Interest Rate = 4, Compounds Per Year = 1.  
Scenario 7: Initial = 25000, Interest Rate = 7, Compounds Per Year = 1.  
Scenario 8: Initial = 25000, Interest Rate = 4, Compounds Per Year = 1.
